              <em>Reflection</em><br/>
              The creation of these pecha kuchas was not my favorite way to spend a day. However, after listening to everyone's presentations and uncovering connections between the different subject matter, most people were able to stretch the question "what is graphic design?" into something pretty interesting. For myself, I chose to approach my questions with a subtle humor, using only Google Image-sourced memes to populate my backgrounds. After having taken a step back, I think the pecha kucha presentation mode is a graphic design constraint and tool I would like to revisit.</p>

            <p class="project_about"> I created a pair of graphic design scrubs as a way to frame and deepen the conversation of graphic designers as service providers. These served partly as a hyperbolic and humorous approach to the subject as well as a way for people to be up front about what matters to them within the field of graphic design.<br/>

            Looking back, this part element of Unit 15 was very fun for me to complete and allowed me to work in a medium I’ve always wanted to try: clothing. That being said, it doesn’t really back the same punch as the other elements of the project and worked more as a moment of comedic releif during the final walk about.</p>

            <p class="project_about"> I wrote my essay and designed an eight page booklet on Walter Keane, husband of Margaret Keane whom he plagiarized paintings from. They were an example, on an obvious level, of how collaborations could fall apart. <br/>
            <br/>
            <em>Reflection</em><br/>
            Personally, I think this was an interesting project when knowing that it would appear all together. However, I found myself pretty frustrated by the timing of it. It felt like a project that was specifically for the department in general rather than an exercise that really helped us learn a lot about collaboration or even book design.</p>

            <br/>
            <em>Reflection</em><br/>
            Perhaps it is more of a personal problem, but I've always really struggled with day workshops. I never feel like I'm actually able to complete the work to my satisfaction. In this case, I felt at an even greater disadvantage because of the web-based aspects. It was still a fun and informative presentaiton, however, I'm not sure the workshop aspect brought me a whole lot closer to understanding.</p>

            <em>Reflection</em><br/>
            At first, I was a little reticent to work in a group of four because of scheduling conflicts and the possibility that we wouldn't work well together. After things got started, however, it worked out very well given the scope of work we wanted to produce and the positive way we were all able to work together.</p>

        <p>Work in progress throughout the semester, unit by unit.
        How does reflection relate to the practice of making and thinking?
        Savor your experience of insight.
        Nurture the reflective practice on your DS work and record these via writing with visual support as needed.
        Reflect on your experiences, curiosities, interests, challenges, observations. Use any writing style that feels comfortable and natural to you — but practice this with sincerity. </p>
